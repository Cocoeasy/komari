This bot is primarily made for GMS with limited support for KMS/CMS/TMS/MSEA. If you're using the bot for a non-mainstream game version (e.g. MSU, Classic, private servers,...), you should try it yourself by changing `Capture Mode` and `Capture Handle` in the `Settings` tab. And I do not guaranteed it will continue to work for these servers in future versions.

Currently, the bot can only solve normal/spinning rune. So it will simply ignore any other types of anti-bot detection systems. However, contributions are always welcome.
