## Sunshine/Moonlight
An example of using Sunshine/Moonlight tested using the below setup:
1. Have the Moonlight settings to `1366x768`, FPS of your choice but increase the Video bitrate around `20Mbps` so the images can be clearer
2. When connecting to the Sunshine host, make sure you don't resize the Moonlight window but only drag it around
3. Set your MapleStory game in Sunshine host to `1366x768` full screen

## Geforce Now
For anyone using Geforce Now, to ensure the bot is working correctly, you need to make sure both the game and Geforce Now have matching resolutions with the game in fullscreen mode similar to Windowed mode setup for Sunshine/Moonlight. An example:
1. Ensure Geforce Now has the same configuration as the game (If game is `1366x768` fullscreen, Geforce Now should also be `1366x768`),
2. Use https://github.com/dtgDTGdtg/SRWE to change Geforce Now window size to same configured size (`1366x768`),
3. Use `BitBltArea` or directly select handle to capture (If directly selecting a handle, you should use `Windows 10` capture mode)
