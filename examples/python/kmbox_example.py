        #   current window the bot is capturing. For example, if you play your game in 1366x768,
        #   then (width, height) = (1366, 768) and (x, y) is offset from top-left corner of that
        #   window with (0, 0) being top-left and (width, height) is bottom-right.
        #
        # - Screen: The MouseRequest coordinates (x, y, width, height) is relative to the
        #   current monitor screen of the app the bot is capturing (which monitor the app is in).
        #   With (0, 0) being top-left of that monitor screen and (width, height) is bottom-right.
        #   For example, your game might be (1366, 768) but it is running in the monitor of size
        #   (1920, 1080) so (width, height) = (1920, 1080).

    def SendMouse(self, request: MouseRequest, context):
        # Regardless of the type of Coordinate return in Init(), the coordinates are always based on

        # - If you run this server on a separate PC than the bot PC and use remote control, this
        #   coordinate is NOT local to the server PC
        #
        # - If you run this server on the same PC as the bot, this coordinate is local to
        #   the server PC
        #
        # The coordinates x, y represent the location the bot wants the input server to click
        # relative to the PC the bot is in. Therefore, it must be transformed first to match your
        # current setup and also to the x, y values your input method can use.
        #
        # For example, KMBox requires x, y values to be relative while SendInput requires
        # the x, y values to be absolute in the range [0, 65535].

        #
        # Case 1: KMBox input server is in the same PC as bot. This case is easier to handle,
        # all you need the current cursor position in order to get the relative movement amount.
        #
        # You need to use Coordinate.Screen for this case.
        # position = pyautogui.position()
        # dx = x - position.x
        # dy = y - position.y

        # Case 2: KMBox input server is in a different PC than the bot. This case can be
        # problematic depending on your setup. For instance, if you use GF Now, when running
        # the game, there are no "status bars" or other non-game UI areas. Your game will always show
        # without any kind of border/bars that might inset the actual game. But if you run your
        # game in something like a VM or Sunshine/Moonlight, these apps can have these
        # bars and the bot always capture the full app and not just the game being shown. So
        # you need to subtract the coordinates by some amount until it feels "correct".
        #
        # You need to use Coordinate.Relative for this case.

        # These are for cropping the non-game UI portion of the app the game is running in.
        # For Moonlight/Sunshine, you can leave this as-is. This method can be unreliable due
        # this reason. You can also use PowerToys Screen Ruler to measure this non-game UI area.

        # Make sure you turn off 'Enhance pointer precision' in 'Mouse Properties' settings. That
